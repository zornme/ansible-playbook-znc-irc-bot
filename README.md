# Summary

I recently rebuilt the VPS I use for ZNC and IRC bots and wanted to test
developing Ansible playbooks with Vagrant.

I had years of IRC logs I didn't want to lose which is why the znc/bot
configurations aren't more nuanced than untarring tarfiles which have been omitted
from this repository. Sorry!

## TODO

1. Proper daemonization of znc/bots
1. Refactor bot
1. ~~Add readme~~
